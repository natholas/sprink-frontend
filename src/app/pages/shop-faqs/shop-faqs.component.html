          You can close your shop at any time (at no cost). This will instantly de-list your dry cleaner from our app.<br>

            Who will pick up an deliver the customer's order?
          </mat-panel-title>
        </mat-expansion-panel-header>
        <p>
          As a Sprink dry cleaner, you'll need to do the pickup and delivery of items. We recommend that you handle all the
          pickups and all the deliveries for each day in one trip - in what we call a 'Sprink run' - to save you time.
        </p>
        <p>
          You'll see pickups and deliveries displayed on your dashboard. Staff accounts that you've added to your shop will be
          able to see these and process each one on the app as they make their Sprink run.
        </p>

            Can I view my shop as a customer would see it?
          </mat-panel-title>
        </mat-expansion-panel-header>
        <p>
          Yes you can. Once you have set up your products and pickup times there will be an option to preview your shop from the viewpoint of a customer.

            How big is the exclusivity area?
          </mat-panel-title>
        </mat-expansion-panel-header>
        <p>
          That depends on how densely populated the area around your dry cleaner is. The exclusivity ranges from 650ft to 1500ft.
        </p>
        <p>
          We will set your exclusivity zone when we approve your dry cleaner.
        </p>

            How does the exclusivity area work?
          </mat-panel-title>
        </mat-expansion-panel-header>
        <p>
          Any Sprink customers that are within your exclusivity zone are guaranteed to be connected to your dry cleaner when they order from Sprink, even if they are closer to another dry cleaner.

            How does Sprink advertise to potential customers?
          </mat-panel-title>
        </mat-expansion-panel-header>
        <p>
          We advertise using a variety of digital platforms including: Google search, Facebook, Instagram & Messenger.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our advertising is targeted around your dry cleaners location.

            How soon after I list my dry cleaner on Sprink will Sprink start advertising to people in my area?
          </mat-panel-title>
        </mat-expansion-panel-header>
        <p>
          We update our advertising roughly once per week. This means that it could take one to two weeks before the adverts for your area start.

          <mat-panel-title>
            Can I do multiple pickup and delivery runs per day?
          </mat-panel-title>
        </mat-expansion-panel-header>
        <p>
          We currently only allow one pickup and delivery run (Sprink run) per day where you pick up and delivery all of orders for that day.
        </p>
        <p>
          We are currently evaluating the possibility of offering multiple Sprink runs per day.
        </p>

            If I list my dry cleaner on Sprink, will I still be allowed to have other customers?
          </mat-panel-title>
        </mat-expansion-panel-header>
        <p>
          Yes!
        </p>
        <p>
          Our goal is to support your business, there is no exclusivity agreement with us.

            Do I need to be a dedicated dry cleaner to sign up for Sprink?
          </mat-panel-title>
        </mat-expansion-panel-header>
        <p>
          No.
        </p>
        <p>
          You need to offer dry cleaning and have enough capacity to handle the extra customers you will receive from Sprink.
        </p>
      </mat-expansion-panel>

      <mat-expansion-panel>
        <mat-expansion-panel-header>
          <mat-panel-title>
            If I list my dry cleaner on Sprink, do I need to display any Sprink branding in my shop?
          </mat-panel-title>
        </mat-expansion-panel-header>
        <p>
          No.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the future we might provide you with free branding materials (Stickers, leaflets, etc.) however displaying them would be optional.
